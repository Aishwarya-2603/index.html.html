        Known best for its extremely delicious Mughlai specialities at maddeningly low prices, the best food items to try at Gulshan-e-Iran range from their Kheema pav to the chicken tikka masala, Garlic Naan, Rabdi Kulfi and Firni for dessert. It’s beautiful how you can ask for the bill after a full stomach and wonder how it’s not crossing the thousand unit mark. Not even close. Gulshan-e-Iran is one of the best street food places in Mumbai and is a must-visit.
