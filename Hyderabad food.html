        Hyderabad is synonymous with great food. It is a royal city with diverse cultures and cuisines dating back to 400 years. The metropolitan city has several food joints in every nook and corner. When in Hyderabad, street food is a must-try, along with the excellent fine-dining options in the city. 
When people from different backgrounds live in a place they bring their own recipes and variation to the food. Hyderabad is a historic city and the Nizams used to reside here, which has largely influenced the cuisine here.

        1.Dosa:
        If you are in Hyderabad, there’s no way that you won’t be having dosa for breakfast or as an evening snack. This is a classic, made in every house. It is also a popular street food option and you can visit the bandis to relish some crisp dosa with podi and coconut chutney. Not only regular dosa, but you can also try different types of dosas in Hyderabad like cheese dosa, paper dosa, pav bhaji dosa, Maggi dosa, mutton keema dosa, and more. You may have had dosas in other parts of the country but there’s nothing like Hyderabadi dosas. These are inexpensive and keep you full for a long time.

        2. Biryani:
This dish developed in the Mughal kitchen is famous for more than one reason. The aromatic basmati rice is made with a mix of Indian spices and the tender pieces of meat will make you salivate in no time. For vegetarians, there is a veg option also available. It is a wholesome meal and you can have it with mirch ka salan or raita.
